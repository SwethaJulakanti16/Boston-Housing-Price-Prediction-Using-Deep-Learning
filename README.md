# üè† Boston Housing Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in Boston using deep learning techniques. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the Boston Housing dataset. It leverages a neural network to estimate continuous values (house prices), making it a regression problem.

## üéØ Project Objective

To develop and evaluate a neural network model that can predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in Boston suburbs based on various input features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers.

## üßæ Dataset Description

- **Dataset:** Boston Housing dataset (`tensorflow.keras.datasets.boston_housing`)
- **Features:** 13 numerical attributes per data point, including:
  - CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
  - RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
  - LSTAT: % lower status of the population
  - ... (total 13 features)
- **Target:** Median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1000s)

## üß™ Results

- Average MAE after 4-fold validation was satisfactory for both models.
- Deeper architecture improved generalization slightly, with reduced validation error.
- MAE decreased with additional layers, but overfitting was monitored using validation curves.
